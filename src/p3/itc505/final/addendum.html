    <h1>Reflections on Modifying a JavaScript Puzzle Game</h1>

    <h2>Designing the Game</h2>
    <p>Objective: To develop a user-friendly and engaging grid-based puzzle.</p>
    <p>Design Decision: Selected a grid structure for its intuitive gameplay.</p>
    <p>Challenge: Creating a simple yet compelling game design.</p>
    <p>Solution: Randomized initial cell states to add depth to the game.</p>

    <h2>Game Mechanic Development</h2>
    <p>Goal: Establish a smooth and interactive system for cell states.</p>
    <p>Design Choice: Created an algorithm to dynamically identify adjacent cells.</p>
    <p>Difficulty: Accurate neighbor identification for border cells.</p>
    <p>Resolution: Implemented a logic based on the position of cells for assigning neighbors.</p>

    <h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
    <p>Aim: To ensure player interactions were intuitive and responsive.</p>
    <p>Innovation: Added event listeners to each cell for dynamic interactions.</p>
    <p>Challenge: Managing event listeners effectively, particularly during game restarts.</p>
    <p>Solution: Developed a system to refresh event listeners for each new game.</p>

    <h2>Defining Winning and Restart Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>Purpose: Establish clear victory conditions and enable game restarts.</p>
    <p>Approach: Defined a win condition with all cells off and added a restart option.</p>
    <p>Problem: Ensuring the game correctly resets and accurately checks for wins.</p>
    <p>Method: Implemented a victory check function and a restart mechanism.</p>

    <h2>Player Interaction and Feedback</h2>
    <p>Objective: Offer immediate and understandable feedback on game interactions.</p>
    <p>Design Approach: Used simple UI elements for feedback and win indications.</p>
    <p>Balance: Achieving a blend of simplicity and informativeness in feedback.</p>
    <p>Implementation: Adopted straightforward UI components for feedback and win alerts.</p>

    <h2>Insights from Development</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Emphasis on the modular approach for adaptable game mechanics.</li>
        <li>The critical role of detail-oriented code modification and understanding dependencies.</li>
        <li>The necessity of thorough testing for a seamless gaming experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Conclusion: The development process highlighted the intricate balance between coding precision, player engagement, and game mechanic flexibility. It showcased the significance of strategic planning and detailed testing in game development.</p>
